# Library DEMO

### Requirements

- JDK 17
- Maven 3.9.5
- Docker or PostgreSQL

### About the DEMO

This is a Spring Boot application implementing a GraphQL service to handle requests related to books and authors.

The controller provides four queries:

- `getBookByName`: Returns a book based on the specified name.
- `getAllBooks`: Retrieves all books present in the repository.
- `getAuthorById`: Fetches an author based on the provided ID.
- `getAllAuthors`: Retrieves all authors available in the repository.

# Getting Started

Follow the steps to start the application:

## Clone

- First, clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-java
  ```

  Navigate to the project folder:

  ```bash
  cd samples-java/spring-boot-postgres-graphql
  ```

## Quick Keploy Installation

- Depending on your OS and preference (Docker/Native), you can set up Keploy using the one-click installation method:
  ```bash
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/keploy/main/keploy.sh && source keploy.sh
  ```

## Setup DB

You have two possible cases:

### Use your postgres installation

If you already have PostgreSQL installed on your machine and want to use this installation, follow these steps:

1. If not already started, launch the PostgreSQL service:

   ```bash
   sudo service postgresql start
   ```

2. Set the password for the postgres user (or alternatively, modify the application.properties file within the project):
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'root';"
   ```
3. Create the demo database:

   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres createdb library_demo
   ```

### Use postgres docker image

If you have Docker installed and prefer a PostgreSQL instance in a container, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
      docker build -t postgres_library:demo ./postgres_demo_docker
   ```

2. Run a container from the generated image:

   ```bash
      docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres postgres_library:demo
   ```

## Use of Keploy

1. Your application is ready to be executed!!
   To start Keploy in record mode, in the root directory, run:

   ```bash
   keploy record -c "mvn spring-boot:run"
   ```

### Query from GraphQL GUI

Now, go to `localhost:8081/graphiql` and access the GraphQL interface to make requests to the application.

- Make a `getAllBooks` query:

  ```graphql
  query {
    getAllBooks {
      name
      author {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- Make a `getBookByName` query:

  ```graphql
  query {
    getBookByName(name: "The Secret of the Moon") {
      id
      name
      pageCount
      author {
        firstName
        lastName
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- Make a `getAllAuthors` query:

  ```graphql
  query {
    getAllAuthors {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
  ```

- Make a `getAuthorById` query:

  ```graphql
  query {
    getAuthorById(id: 2) {
      firstName
    }
  }
  ```

You can experiment with the data you want to retrieve from the query by removing or rearranging fields.

The generated tests and mocks are stored in the `Keploy` directory in the current working directory.

### Execute tests

To test the app, start Keploy in test mode. In the root directory, run:

```bash
   keploy test -c "mvn spring-boot:run" --delay 15
```

This will run the tests and generate the report in the `Keploy/reports` directory in the current working directory.
