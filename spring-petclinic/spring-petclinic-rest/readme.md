## üé§ Introducing Keploy üê∞
Keploy is a **developer-centric** backend testing tool. It makes **backend tests with built-in-mocks**, faster than unit tests, from user traffic, making it **easy to use, powerful, and extensible**. üõ†

Ready for the magic? Here are Keploy's core features:

- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Combined Test Coverage:** Merge your Keploy Tests with your fave testing libraries(JUnit, go-test, py-test, jest) to see a combined test coverage.


- ü§ñ **EBPF Instrumentation:** Keploy uses EBPF like a secret sauce to make integration code-less, language-agnostic, and oh-so-lightweight.


- üåê **CI/CD Integration:** Run tests with mocks anywhere you like‚Äîlocally on the CLI, in your CI pipeline, or even across a Kubernetes cluster. It's testing wherever you want it!


- üé≠ **Multi-Purpose Mocks:** Use 'em in existing tests, as server tests, or just to impress your friends!


- üìΩÔ∏è **Record-Replay Complex Flows:** Keploy can record and replay complex, distributed API flows as mocks and stubs. It's like having a time machine for your tests‚Äîsaving you tons of time!

On MacOS and Windows, additional tools are required for Keploy due to the lack of native eBPF support.

# üöÄ Quick Installation

To get started let's set Keploy alias by running. 

```shell
 curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/keploy/main/keploy.sh && source keploy.sh
```

## Capturing Testcases

To initiate the recording of API calls, execute this command in your terminal:

```zsh
keploy record -c "CMD_TO_RUN_APP" 
```
For example, if you're using a simple Golang program, the **CMD_TO_RUN_APP** would resemble:

```zsh
keploy record -c "go run main.go"
```

## Running Testcases
To run the testcases and generate a test coverage report, use this terminal command:

```zsh
keploy test -c "CMD_TO_RUN_APP" --delay 10
```

### Recording Testcases and Data Mocks

Here are a few points to consider before recording!
- If you're running via **docker-compose**, ensure to include the `<CONTAINER_NAME>` under your application service in the docker-compose.yaml file [like this](https://github.com/keploy/samples-python/blob/9d6cf40da2eb75f6e035bedfb30e54564785d5c9/flask-mongo/docker-compose.yml#L14).
- You must run all of the containers on the same network when you're using **docker run command** (you can add your custom **network name** using `--network` flag in **docker run command**).
- In your **Docker Compose** file, every container should run on the same network.
- `Docker_CMD_to_run_user_container` refers to the Docker **command for launching** the application.
- Add the required commands to your DockerFile as stated below.

```Dockerfile
...
# Download the ca.crt file
RUN curl -o ca.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/keploy/main/pkg/proxy/asset/ca.crt

RUN curl -o setup_ca.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/keploy/main/pkg/proxy/asset/setup_ca.sh

# Give execute permission to the setup_ca.sh script
RUN chmod +x setup_ca.sh
...

# Run the CA setup script and then run the application server
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "source ./setup_ca.sh && <your app running command>"]
```
Note: Also add **curl** installation command if **curl** is not installed on your image

To capture test cases, **Execute** the following command within your application's **root directory**.

```shell
keploy record -c "Docker_CMD_to_run_user_container --network <network_name>" --containerName "<container_name>"
```
Perform API calls using tools like [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or cURL commands.

Keploy will capture the API calls you've conducted, generating test suites comprising **test cases (KTests) and data mocks (KMocks)** in `YAML` format.

### Running Testcases

To execute the test cases, follow these steps in the **root directory** of your application.

When using **docker-compose** to start the application, it's important to ensure that the `--containerName` parameter matches the container name in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.


```shell
keploy test -c "Docker_CMD_to_run_user_container --network <network_name>" --containerName "<container_name>" --delay 20
```

Voil√†! üßëüèª‚Äçüíª We have the tests with data mocks running! üê∞üéâ

You'll be able to see the test cases that ran with the results report on the console as well as locally in the `testReport` directory.

## üê≤ The Challenges We Face!
- **Unit Testing:** While Keploy is designed to run alongside unit testing frameworks (Go test, JUnit..) and can add to the overall code coverage, it still generates integration tests.
- **Production Lands**: Keploy is currently focused on generating tests for developers. These tests can be captured from any environment, but we have not tested it on high volume production environments. This would need robust deduplication to avoid too many redundant tests being captured. We do have ideas on building a robust deduplication system [#27](https://github.com/keploy/keploy/issues/27)
