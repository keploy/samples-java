# Create Repository

A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. Keploy uses repositories to store files, revision history, carry out discussions, manage the project work and accept contributions from our diverse contributors. To get started with creating a repository, please follow these steps:

If you are a member of the keploy organization, define a new repository:

- Use a short version of your title as the repository name: keploy/repository-name.
- Use the full title as the description of the repository.
- Make the repository public.
- Instead of initialising it with a README. We can directly select this template repository while creating a new public repo as the base.
- Create your repository.
- If you are not a member of the Keploy organization, the Keploy team will create the repository for you and invite you as an external member to take charge of the project. Follow these steps:

Navigate to the template repository.
Click Issues.
Click the green button Get Started in the Feature Request box.
Use the title of your project as the title of the requested features.
In the body of the Issue, provide the abstract of your project first. Then follow the template to the extent it is useful and provide as much information as possible.
Attach files, screenshots and/or animated GIFs
Click the green button "Submit New Issue" at the bottom right corner.
