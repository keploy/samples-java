# Continuous Integration Tools

Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

While not yet implemented, Keploy intends to utilise Continuous Integration Tools. Continuous Integration allows multiple developers to work on a software project while integrating their changes and maintaining the stability and quality of the software.

Continuous Integration fosters innovation by ensuring that ongoing improvements are always available and compatible to a set of users. This would allow a user developing their own countries implementation could progressively add new data and features while maintaining a functioning, reproducible system

Two Integration Tools have been identified for Continuous Integration with Keploy:

- We use Github Actions to supports Continuous Integration and testing .
